## Project Notes

This bday project taught me how to combine animated images (using webp rather than gif for efficiency) with hover effects. It was a great refresher in basic HTML and CSS styling. About 80% of this code is written by me (the rest was riffing off of a template). 

And Happy Birthday Anna!
